## How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Dev4Devs project. We want
keep this process as easy as possible so we've outlined a few guidelines below.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue in the repository of this project, assuming one does
not already exist.
* Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
* Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
* This is usually the master branch.
* To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b
&lt;branch name&gt; master`.
* Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Prepend your commit messages with a Issute ticket number, e.g. "fix(ISSUE-1234):
 typo mistake in README."
* Follow the coding style in use.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Submitting changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository of this project and choose branch you want to patch
 (usually master).
* Advanced users may want to install the https://hub.github.com/[GitHub CLI]
and use the `hub pull-request` command.
* Update your ISSUE ticket to mark that you have submitted code and are ready
for it to be reviewed (Link the PR on it).
* Include a link to the pull request in the ticket.
* Add detail about the change to the pull request including screenshots if the change affects the UI.

## Reviewing changes

* After submitting a pull request, one of Dev4Devs team members will review it.
* Changes may be requested to conform to our style guide and internal requirements.
* When the changes are approved and all tests are passing, a Dev4Devs team member will merge them.

NOTE: If you have write access to the repository, do not directly merge pull requests. Let another team member review your pull request and approve it.
