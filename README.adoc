== Overview

A very flexible and customizable https://commons.openshift.org/sig/OpenshiftOperators.html[Operator] in Go developed using the https://github.com/operator-framework[ Operator Framework] to package, install, configure and manage a PostgreSQL database.

== Prerequisites

|===
|https://golang.org/doc/install[Install Golang]
|https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH[Ensure the $GOPATH environment variable is set]
|https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/installation.html[Install the dep package manager]
|https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk#quick-start[Install Operator-SDK]
|https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl[Install kubectl]
|===

== Getting Started

NOTE: The following steps will allow you use this project as standalone.

=== Cloning the repository

By the following commands you will create a local directory and clone this project.

[source,shell]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:dev4devs-com/postgresql-operator.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/dev4devs-com/postgresql-operator
----

=== Minishift installation and setup

https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html[Install Minishift] then enable Operators on it by running the following commands.

[source,shell]
----
# create a new profile to test the operator
$ minishift profile set postgresql-operator

# enable the admin-user add-on
$ minishift addon enable admin-user

# add insecure registry to download the images from docker
$ minishift config set insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16

# start the instance
$ minishift start
----

=== Installing

Use the following command to install the Operator and Database

NOTE: To install you need be logged in as a user with cluster privileges like the `system:admin` user. E.g. By using: `oc login -u system:admin`.

[source,shell]
----
$ make install
----

=== Verifying

To verify that the installation was successful completed you can check the  `Database Status` field of link:./deploy/crds/postgresqloperator_v1alpha1_postgresql_crd.yaml[Postgresql CRD] in the cluster. The expected result when all was installed with success is `OK`.

```shell
$ oc describe Postgresql
...
Status:
  Database Status:  OK
...
```

NOTE: Following an example of the fully expect result after run `make install`.

[source,shell]

----

=== Uninstalling

Use the following command to delete the Operator, Database and Backup Service if enabled.

[source,shell]
----
$ make uninstall
----

NOTE: To uninstall you need be logged in as a user with cluster privileges like the `system:admin` user. E.g. By using: `oc login -u system:admin`.

== Configuration and Options

=== Using configMap to share required values

By the specs in link:./deploy/crds/postgresqloperator_v1alpha1_postgresql_cr.yaml[Postgresql CR] you are able to customize the setup for this operator. Note that by the spec `configMapName` you are able to inform the name of a configMapName which has the keys and values which the PostgreSQL should use in its required env vars.

If just the name of the configMap be informed, `configMapName`,  then it will look for the values stored with the same keys required for each env var of the image used for its database version (`databaseNameParam`, `databasePasswordParam`, `databaseUserParam`). However, you are able to customize the keys too by using the optional specs; `configMapDatabaseNameParam`, `configMapDatabasePasswordParam`, `configMapDatabaseUserParam`. In this way, this operator will be able to looking for the values stored in some config with keys which are not the ones used to create the environment variables used in the database deployment.

=== Changing the operator namespace

By using the command `make install` the default namespace `postgresql`,  defined in the link:./Makefile[Makefile] will be created and the operator will be installed in this namespace. You are able to install the operator in another namespace if you wish, however, you need to set up its roles (RBAC) in order to apply them on the namespace where the operator will be installed. The namespace name needs to be changed in the link:./deploy/role_binding.yaml[Cluster Role Binding] file. Note, that you also need to change the namespace in the link:./Makefile[Makefile] in order to use the command `make install` for another namespace.

[source,yaml]
----
  # Replace this with the namespace where the operator will be deployed.
  namespace: postgresql
----

=== Configuring the Backup Service

==== Backup

===== Install
The backup service is implemented by using  https://github.com/integr8ly/backup-container-image[integr8ly/backup-container-image]. It will do the backup of the database to be restore in the case of failures. Following the steps to enable it.

. Setup the AWS in order to store the backup outside of the cluster. You need to add your AWS details to link:./postgresql-operator/deploy/crds/postgresqloperator_v1alpha1_backup_cr.yaml[Backup CR] as follows or add the name of the secret which has already this data in the cluster.
+
[source,yaml]
----
  # ---------------------------------
  # Stored Host - AWS
  # ----------------------------

  awsS3BucketName: "example-awsS3BucketName"
  awsAccessKeyId: "example-awsAccessKeyId"
  awsSecretAccessKey: "example-awsSecretAccessKey"
----
+
IMPORTANT: Also, you can add the name of the secret which is created already in the cluster.
+
. Run the command `make backup/install` in the same namespace where the  Database is installed in order to apply the CronJob which will do this process.

NOTE: To install you need be logged in as a user with cluster privileges like the `system:admin` user. E.g. By using: `oc login -u system:admin`.

===== Verifying

To verify that the backup has been successful created you can run the following command in the namespace where the operator is installed.

[source,shell]
----
$ oc get cronjob.batch/backup
NAME      SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE    LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
backup     0 * * * *   False     0         13s             12m
----

To check the jobs executed you can run the command `oc get jobs` in the namespace where the operator is installed as the following example.

[source,shell]
----
$ oc get jobs
NAME               DESIRED   SUCCESSFUL   AGE
backup-1561588320   1         0            6m
backup-1561588380   1         0            5m
backup-1561588440   1         0            4m
backup-1561588500   1         0            3m
----

NOTE: In the above example the schedule was made to run this job each minute (`*/1 * * * *`)

To check the logs and troubleshooting you can run the command `oc logs $podName -f` in the namespace where the operator is installed as the following example.

[source,shell]
----
 $ oc logs job.batch/backup-1561589040 -f

----

==== Restore

Following the steps required to be performed in case of be required do the restore based in the backup service.

. Install the PostgreSQL by following the steps in <<Installing>>.
. Restore the database with the dump which was stored in the AWS S3 bucket.
+
NOTE: To restore we should run `gunzip -c filename.gz | psql dbname`

== Architecture

This operator is `cluster-scoped`. For further information see the https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user-guide.md#operator-scope[Operator Scope] section in the Operator Framework documentation. Also, check its roles in link:./deploy/[Deploy] directory.

NOTE: The operator and database will be installed in the namespace `{namespace}` which will be created by this project.

== Development

=== Local Setup

Run the following command to setup this project locally.

[source,yaml]
----
$ make setup
----

=== Running the operator locally

The following command will install the operator in the cluster and run the changes performed locally without the need to publish a `dev` tag. In this way, you can verify your code in the development environment.

[source,yaml]
----
$ make code/run/local
----

IMPORTANT: The local changes are applied when the command `operator-sdk up local --namespace={namespace}` is executed then it is not a hot deploy and to get the latest changes you need re-run the command.

=== Checking Database

By the following commands you are able to connect in the Database. You can check it by OpenShift UI in the Database's pod terminal.

[source,shell]
----
# Login into the the Postgres
psql -U postgres

# To connect into the default database
\c <database-name>

# To list the tables
\dt

NOTE: The link:./Makefile[Makefile] is implemented with tasks which you should use to work with.

== Publishing images

Images are automatically built and pushed to our https://quay.io/repository/dev4devs-com/postgresql-operator[image repository] in the following cases:

- For every change merged to master a new image with the `master` tag is published.
- For every change merged that has a git tag a new image with the `<operator-version>` and `latest` tags are published.

If the image does not get built and pushed automatically the job may be re-run manually via the https://circleci.com/gh/dev4devs-com/postgresql-operator[CI dashboard].

== Release Tags

Following the steps

* Create a new version tag following the http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html[semver], for example `0.1.0`
* Bump the version in the link:./version/version.go[version.go] file.
* Update the the link:./CHANGELOG.MD[CHANGELOG.MD] with the new release.
* Create a git tag with the version value, for example:

[source,shell]
----
$ git tag -a 0.1.0 -m "version 0.1.0"
----

* Push the new tag to the upstream repository, this will trigger an automated release by the CI, for example:

[source,shell]
----
$ git push upstream 0.1.0
----

NOTE: The image with the tag will be created and pushed to the https://quay.io/repository/dev4devs-com/postgresql-operator[postgresql-operator image hosting repository] by the CI.

WARNING: Do not use letters in the tag such as `v`. It will not work.

== Supportability

This operator was developed using the Kubernetes APIs in order to be compatible with OpenShift and Kubernetes.
